# NumberShapes
A simple one Activity App, that shows if one number typed is a Square number or a Triangular Number. The App uses a Library for custom Toasts(pprathameshmore:Toasty:v1.2) that display the Toast on the Bottom or Top of the app itself, to let the user knows if the number is a square or triangular one.
